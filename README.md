# Introduction

This is a repository consisting of some analysis and representation of data over the IPL Data set available on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl 

IPL data is available on kaggle as two csv files :
1. matches.csv - Consist of 636 rows × 18 columns
2. deliveries.csv - Consist of 150460 rows × 21 columns

At first, i transformed these data files from raw csv format to a data structure in a format suitable for plotting with matplotlib.

I have covered basic analysis of Ipl during 2008 - 2017 as :

1. Compute and Plot the number of matches played per season of all the seasons in IPL [2008-2017].
2. Compute and Plot a stacked bar chart of matches won of all teams over all the seasons of IPL [2008-2017].
3. Compute and Plot the extra runs conceded per team for season 2016.
4. Compute and plot the top economical bowlers for season 2015.
5. Compute and Plot stacked bar chart for total number of matches won over toss decision as bat/field over all the seasons [2008-2017]

## Instructions :
- Execute main.py file in IPL-Data-Project directory.
- There are five resulting plot files (.png format) representing my analysis.
